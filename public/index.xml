      <description>Countries in MENA region have a high prevalence of consanguinous marriage yet there is not much information about how the genetic counsellers are trained in these countries.
Ormond has provided a comprehensive review of the genetic counseling status in different countries in the world. The paper includes information about Israel and Saudi Arabia. SNPedia is another source for finding some information about genetic couselling in MENA region. And it only had provided links for Israel and Saudi Arabia.</description>

      <description>Most of the ordinary people do not know about the genes and chromosomes.
Definition of genetic literacy presented by Bowling is “sufficient knowledge and appreciation of genetic principles to allow informed decision-making for personal well-being and effective participation in social decisions on genetic issues”.
There are other studies exploring public understading of genetics. Dr Michael Dougherty has several papers discussing about the chanlleges of public education about genetics. His studies are focued on USA educational system.</description>

      <title>Why sharing photo?!</title>

      <description>Obtaining informed consent for photo sharing is one of the challenges that genetic researchers in counteries in MENA region encounter. Most of the parents are reluctant to share their child’ photo.
The traditional formats of manuscripts - writing about participants in Material and methods section - have led to the wrong culture among the researchers to objectify patients. I witnesses times that the patient’s guardians were handed a consent form explaining the usage of the sample and confidentiality of the patient information including data and photos.</description>

      <description>Many institutes have policies and guidelines for collborative studies. What other criteria research leaders consider when starting a collaborative studies? There are some criteria in a paper published by Professor Michael Parker in 2016.
Here a brief note is provided.
 1- Engaging the collaborators in the study conception and the intellectual work. 2- Requesting for the information about the patients and high-quality samples according to a timetable. 3- Ensuring high quality research with excellent proposal.</description>

      <description>MENA is home for countries with a high percentage of consangunous marriage and , consequently, has a high prevalence of rare genetic diseases. In many countries in MENA patients could not afford the genetic tests expenses and scientists do not have enough fund for their research. On the other hand, there are scientists in other countries having funds who do not have enough samples for their research. In addition, although Next Generation Sequencing resulted in sequencing human genome with lower price, it provides a handful of variants which their significance is unknown.</description>
