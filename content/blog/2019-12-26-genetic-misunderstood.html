<p>Most of the ordinary people do not know about the genes and chromosomes.</p>
<p>Definition of genetic literacy presented by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2206067/">Bowling</a> is “sufficient knowledge and appreciation of genetic principles to allow informed decision-making for personal well-being and effective participation in social decisions on genetic issues”.</p>
<p>There are other studies exploring public understading of genetics. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-dougherty-phd-b423919/">Dr Michael Dougherty</a> has several papers discussing about the chanlleges of public education about genetics. His studies are focued on USA educational system. However, I still consider most of his findings relevant to countries in MENA region.</p>
<p>Misconceptions about genetics and inheritence is not unique to ordinary people. It also exist among professional. Robert Chapman et al. investigated the genetic knowledge among educated people in their <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12687-018-0363-7">paper</a> published in 2018. The group used the International Genetic Literacy and Attitudes Survey <a href="https://tagc.world/iglas/">(iGLAS)</a> for assessing genetic knowledge. The same approach could be used by the developing countries to evaluate the genetic knowledge of the public and develope educational programs based on the findings.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many advances in genetics that have broad applications in medicine and society. Therefore, educating public should be addressed properly by the health eductors. Genetic literacy in young population living in developing countries is affected by other factors. Lack of sex and marriage education for teenagers, tradiational views on marriage which is influenced by relegion and culture and lack of policy to prevent child marriage are some factors that not only could lead to high percentage of consanguinous marriage but also prevent genetic education in teenagers. In these countries government might not be willing to add genetics as a part of curriculum for all the school goers. Therefore, other organizations must provide training for the public using social media or outreach programs.</p>
