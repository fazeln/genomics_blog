<h3>Does genomics precision lead to more health disparity?</h3>
<p>The genomics databases used for guideing precision medicine is populated with the Genomics information of people with European ancestry populations. Theses databases are used for biomarker discovery, predicting the pathogenecity of a rare variant. It is widely accepted that theses databases have little use for genomics studies of minororities and other races.</p>
<p>[ <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02678-7">Jyoti Madhusoodanan</a> draws our attention in how precision oncology can increase health disparities. We cannot estimate how much the genomics technologies can influence health inequalities because there are other factors including socioeconomics, health insuarance, location and education impacting health inequalities within a community.</p>
<p>Genomic technologies also contributed in widenning the gap between low-, middle- and high-income countries. The genomics databases widely used in research are developed by high-income countries that uses mostly samples from individuals of European ancestry. These databases recorded little information about Asian or African nations. Other health pririties, lack of appropriate infrastructure and faninacial burdon are other reasons that new genomics innovations is rarely used in middle- and low-income countries. The Human Genetics programme (HGN) developed by <a href="https://www.who.int/genomics/en/">WHO</a>could help WHO Member States to reach their public health goals.</p>
<p>In a paper published in <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/fulltext/S0168-9525(20)30167-0">Cell</a>, it is stated that disadvantaged people can benefit from personalized medicine with the emergence of the new tools and studying large cohorts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.genome.gov/event-calendar/Genomics-Health-Disparities-Lecture-Series">The Genomics and Health Disparities Lecture Series</a> has been running since 2015. The lectures addresses the genomics’s impact on health disparity.</p>
<p>I think genomics studies using large cohort including minorities would be beneficial to both science and health sciences. However, to encourage minorities to participate in the studies would be a challenge because of the public’s mistrust to science. Providing educational programs and transparency are keys to attract healthy doners. Whenever, it is possible participants should be reimburressed for the costs incurred. New technologies if lowers the cost of genomics sequencing are beneficial to low- or middle-income countries so that they could creat their own population databases. However, it should be noticed that these databases can be abused in countires with a record of human right violations as they can be used to further discriminate against minorities. Therefore, a universal agency might be needed to regulate use of the genomics data.</p>
