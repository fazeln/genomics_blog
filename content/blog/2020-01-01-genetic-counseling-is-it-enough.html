<p>Countries in MENA region have a high prevalence of consanguinous marriage yet there is not much information
about how the genetic counsellers are trained in these countries.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29575600/">Ormond</a> has provided a comprehensive review of the genetic counseling status in different countries
in the world. The paper includes information about Israel and Saudi Arabia. <a href="https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Find_a_genetic_counselor">SNPedia</a> is another source for finding some information about genetic couselling in MENA region. And it only had
provided links for Israel and Saudi Arabia. Sure there are many great genetic councellors in other countries in the region.
However, this profession is not well-organised in them.</p>
<p>Genetics is affecting our life in many ways from the food we eat or our decision to end pregnancy. Not having professionals educating the public provides an opportunity for pseduscience to spread misinformations about the GMOs or usage of genetic tests.</p>
<p>Countries in MENA should adopt a comprehensive specialised training program for genetic counselors and develop easy ways for the patients to find a genetic counselors. In addition, genetic counselors must be actively involved in educating public.</p>
