Obtaining informed consent for photo sharing is one of the challenges that genetic researchers in counteries in MENA region encounter.
Most of the parents are reluctant to share their child' photo. 

The traditional formats of manuscripts - writing about participants in Material and methods section - 
have led to the wrong culture among the researchers to objectify patients. I witnesses times that the patient's guardians 
were handed a consent form explaining the usage of the sample and confidentiality of the  patient information including data and photos.
Most of these families did not have tertiary education and did not know what is exactly a paper or a scientific conference which their photo might be used. 
As a result, they were reluctant to consent in taking the photo or even participating in the study.


Being transparent and communicating effectively with the patients' family help them to make informed decisions.

### What steps should be taken to help patients make an informed decision?

First, change the conventional consent form that has been used in your lab for a decade. In a paper published by [Nguyen et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31370847/) in 2019, a few guidelines are provided for designing a consent form. If you do not have time to read the full paper, take a look at the tables. They contain very useful information about the trends in rare diseases research, essential elements of a consent form and suggested clauses to be used in the form.

Second, have a professional to communicate the study to the participants from the beginning to the end. Not all the participants majored in biology.
Most of them do not know about the genes. The designed person should take some time to convey information without using jargons. Visuals are very useful. They should also be informed about the outcome of the study and if any publication or other presentation of results in scientific meetings they should be kept updated. That will build trust.

##### Participant should know that  

> Their contribution to the research is valued
>
> Their photo sharing helps in their diagnosis.
>
> Their photo sharing could help another patient diagnosis.

Third, have some examples to show how patients' data is helping advances in diagnosis.
My two recommendations are new computational phenotyping tools taking advatage of the photos shared by the patients [face2gene](https://www.face2gene.com/) and [Minerva & Me](https://www.minervaandme.com/)


Having a transparent consent form, and communicating effectively help participants to understand the advantages and disadvantages of taking part in a research project and making an informed desicion.
