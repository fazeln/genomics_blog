Having worked in various capacities, developed excellent organizational and interpersonal skills. My name is Esmat Fazel. 

I studied genetics with a master thesis focused on human genetics. During my studies and through work experience I developed problem-solving, teamwork and creativity skills. I am proficient in R and constantly improving my skills in Python. During a short training program at the University of Queensland I started to learn Perl and obtained experience in using cluster. 

I love to apply my knowledge to community. This blog is a result of my passion for genetics, research, learning, teaching and my community. I developed this blog using blogdown. The contents can be used freely for educating the patients and health providers. 
If you like my writings, please support me by your donations.
