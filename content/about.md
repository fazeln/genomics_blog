MENA is home for countries with a high percentage of consangunous marriage and , consequently, has a high prevalence of rare genetic diseases. In many countries in MENA patients could not afford the genetic tests expenses and scientists do not have enough fund for their research. On the other hand, there are scientists in other countries having funds who do not have enough samples for their research. In addition, although Next Generation Sequencing resulted in sequencing human genome with lower price, it provides a handful of variants which their significance is unknown. To resolve if a variant is pathogen or not functional studies and additional patients with the same phenotype are needed which both can hardly be accomplished by a single group.

Therefore, a collaborative research study by these scientists not only could lead to a diagnosis but also a treatment.

MENA Omics MEdicine (MENAOME) is dedicated to establish collaboration between researchers in MENA countries and other countries in the world to hep patients with genetic disease.
